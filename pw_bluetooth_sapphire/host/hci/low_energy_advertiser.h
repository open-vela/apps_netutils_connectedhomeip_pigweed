  //
  //   1. The type of |address| is "LE Public". The advertised address always
  //   corresponds to the controller's BD_ADDR. This is the case in both legacy
  //   and extended advertising.
  //
  //   2. The type of |address| is "LE Random" and the advertiser implements
  //   legacy advertising. Since the controller local address is shared between
  //   scan, initiation, and advertising procedures, the advertiser cannot
  //   configure this address without interfering with the state of other
  //   ongoing procedures.
  //
  // We should either revisit this interface or update the documentation to
  // reflect the fact that the |address| is sometimes a hint and may or may not
  // end up being advertised. Currently the GAP layer decides which address to
  // pass to this call but the layering should be revisited when we add support
  // for extended advertising.
